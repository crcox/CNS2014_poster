\item {\bf PDP models} have motivated many influential hypotheses. 

\item {\bf Distributed representations} are at the heart, responsible the learning, responding, generalizing, and predicting that the models are capable of.

\item However, there is limited neural evidence for distributed representations, e.g. from fMRI.

\item There may be a disconnect between methods of analysis and representational assumptions of PDP that {\bf systematically overlook} distributed patterns in the brain. 

\item {\bf SOS LASSO} is an optimization technique that is sensitive to distributed representations, {\em similarly located} in {\em samples of subjects}.
